AI Voice Chat App
Overview
The AI Voice Chat App is a project designed to create a seamless and interactive voice-based communication experience between users and an artificial intelligence (AI) system. The application allows users to provide voice prompts, and the AI will respond intelligently based on natural language understanding.

Features
Voice Input:
Users can record voice prompts using their device's microphone. The app captures these voice inputs for further processing.

AI Interaction:
The recorded voice prompts are sent to the AI system, which interprets and analyzes the user's input. The AI responds with relevant and context-aware information.

Natural Language Processing (NLP):
The AI system employs advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and interpret user queries accurately. This includes language understanding, sentiment analysis, and context awareness.

Dynamic Prompt Handling:
The AI system handles dynamic prompts, adapting its responses based on user interactions and the evolving context of the conversation.

User Feedback:
The app provides a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the AI's responses. This feedback loop helps improve the system's performance over time.

User Authentication:
To enhance personalization and security, users can create accounts and log in, allowing the AI to learn from previous interactions and tailor responses to individual preferences.

Technologies Used
Speech Recognition: Utilizing artyom.js to convert voice inputs into text for further processing.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Employing NLP models and frameworks to understand and generate human-like responses.
Backend Development: Building a robust backend system to handle user authentication, data storage, and communication with the AI model.
Frontend Development: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for recording voice prompts and displaying AI responses.
